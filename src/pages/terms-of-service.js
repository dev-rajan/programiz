          result of any third-party using your Login Credentials and/or
          accessing/using your User Account either with or without your
          knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, you may be held liable for losses incurred by Programiz PRO
          due to any third-party using your Login Credentials and/or User
          Account. You acknowledge and agree that you may not (i) use the User
          Account of another user registered on the Website, and further

            Should Programiz PRO be unable to collect payment from your verified

            Programiz PRO may in its sole discretion and at any time modify,
            terminate, or otherwise amend the Subscription Plan fees and
            features associated with your subscription. If we notify you in
            advance of at least fifteen (15) days, your continued use of the
            Website and the E-Learning Platform after the changes have been made
            will constitute your acceptance of the changes.
            <p>
              If you do not wish to continue subscribing with the new fees or
              features, you may terminate your subscription by canceling at any
              time. If you accept the new subscription, its terms and conditions

            not notify Programiz PRO of any billing queries and/or errors, such
            absence of notification on your part shall be deemed to constitute
            your waiver of your right to dispute such queries and errors at a
            later date.

          </li>
          <li>
            We occasionally run promotions and sales for our content, during
            which Subscription plans are available at discounted prices for a
            set period of time. The price applicable to the Subscription Plan
            will be the price at the time you complete your purchase of the
            content (at checkout). Any price offered for particular content may
            also be different when you are logged into your account from the
            price available to users who aren&apos;t registered or logged in,
            because some of our promotions are available only to new users.

          <li>
            You acknowledge and agree that Programiz PRO may, from time to time,
            add additional features or functionalities to the Services; as such
            your access to and use of any additional features and
            functionalities to the Services may require the payment of

            assessments of any nature, whether disputed or not, including any
            value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes, assessable by any
            jurisdiction (“Taxes”).
            <p>
              If you are located in a country where sales tax, goods and
              services tax, or value added tax is applicable to consumer sales,
              our payment partner Paddle is responsible for collecting and
              remitting that tax to the proper tax authorities.
            </p>
            <p>
              Depending on your location, the price you see may include such
              taxes, or tax may be added at checkout.

              and hold Programiz PRO harmless from the payment of any Taxes and
              costs associated with the collection or withholding thereof,
              including penalties and interest. If Programiz PRO is under a
              legal obligation to pay or collect Taxes for which you are
              responsible, the applicable amount shall be invoiced to and paid
              by you unless you provide Programiz PRO with a valid tax exemption
              certificate from the applicable taxing authority.

          <li>
            Programiz PRO will be entitled to injunctive or other equitable
            relief (without the obligations of posting any bond or surety) in
            the event of any breach or anticipatory breach by you.
          </li>
          <li>
            Programiz PRO operates and controls the Programiz PRO Services from
            its offices in Nepal. The Services are not intended for distribution
            to or use by any person or entity in any jurisdiction or country
            where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or
            regulation. Accordingly, those persons who choose to access the
            Programiz PRO Services from other locations do so on their own
            initiative and are solely responsible for compliance with local
            laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable. The section
            headings used in these Terms are for convenience only and will not
            be given any legal import.
          </li>
          <li>
            Non-Exclusivity. These Terms do not create an exclusive relationship
            between the Parties. Programiz PRO is free to engage with other
            clients and to provide the same or similar Services as provided by
            Programiz PRO to you under these Terms. You shall be entitled to
            solicit and engage with other third-party entities/companies in
            order to obtain and access same or similar services and/or products.
          </li>
          <li>
            Force Majeure. Programiz PRO shall not be liable or responsible for
            any failure to perform any act or fulfill any duty or obligation
            connected to these Terms when and to the extent that such action is
            caused by any occurrence beyond its reasonable control including,
            but not limited to, acts of God (fire, storm, floods, earthquakes,
            etc.), acts of terrorism, civil disturbances, pandemics, disruption
            of telecommunications, disruption of power or other essential
            services, interruption or termination of services provided by any
            service providers used by the Company, labor disturbances,
            vandalism, cable cut, computer viruses or other similar occurrences,
            or any malicious or unlawful acts of any third party.
          </li>
          <li>
            Severability. In the event that any provision of these Terms shall
            be unenforceable or invalid under any applicable law or be so held
            by any applicable court decision, such unenforceability or
            invalidity shall not render the remaining provisions of these Terms
            unenforceable or invalid, and, in such event, such remaining
            provisions shall be changed and interpreted so as to best accomplish
            the objectives of such unenforceable or invalid provision within the
            limits of applicable law or applicable court decision(s).
          </li>
          <li>
            No Waiver. Unless specifically mentioned otherwise, each Party
            agrees that any delay or omission on the part of the other Party to
            exercise any right, power or remedy under these Terms will not
            automatically operate as a waiver of such right, power or remedy or
            any other right, power or remedy and no waiver will be effective
            unless it is in writing and signed by the waiving Party. Further the
            waiver or the single or partial exercise of any right, power or
            remedy by either Party hereunder on one occasion will not be
            construed as a bar to a waiver of any successive or other right,
            power or remedy on any other occasion.
          </li>
          <li>
            No Assignment. Neither these Terms nor any rights under these Terms
            may be assigned or otherwise transferred by you, whether voluntarily
            or by operation of law, without the prior written consent of
            Programiz PRO. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will be binding
            upon and will insure to the benefit of the Parties and their
            respective successors and assigns. Any assignment in violation of
            the foregoing shall be null and void.
