        <h3>9. Security measures</h3>
        <p>
          The security of your information is important to us. We follow
          generally accepted standards to protect the personal data submitted to
          us, both during transmission and once we receive it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Taking into account relevant developments in technology including
          telecommunications and web services, technical limitations associated
          with different telecommunications protocols, the costs of
          implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of
          processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for
          the rights and freedoms of natural persons, we shall in relation to
          the personal data implement appropriate technical and organizational
          measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to that risk.
        </p>
        <p>
          We use a variety of security measures to ensure the confidentiality of
          your personal data, and to protect your personal data from loss,
          theft, unauthorized access, misuse, alteration or destructure.
        </p>
        <p>
          No method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure,
          however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please always check that any website on which you are asked for
          financial or payment information in relation to our reservations or
          Service is operated by us or by third-party service providers
          authorised by us. If you do receive a suspicious request, do not
          provide your information and report it as set out in this Privacy
          Policy.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse, unauthorized
          acquisition, or alteration of your data will not occur. Please
          recognize that you play a vital role in protecting your own personal
          data. You are responsible for keeping your User Account passcode,
          membership numbers and pin numbers safe and secure. Do not share those
          with anyone. If there is unauthorised use or any other breach of
          security involving your information, you must notify us as soon as
          possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, we cannot ensure or warrant the security or
          confidentiality of information you transmit to us or receive from us
          by internet or wireless connection, including email since we have no
          way of protecting that information once it leaves and until it reaches
          us. If you have reason to believe that your data is no longer secure,
          please contact us using the contact information provided in this
          Privacy Policy.

        <ul>
          <li>
            <h4>Scope</h4>
            <p>
              This section applies solely to data subjects as defined by the
              General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) (“EU data subjects”).
              For these purposes, reference to the EU also includes the European
              Economic Area countries of Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway and,
              where applicable, and Switzerland. Reference to the EU also
              includes the UK in the case when the scope of GDPR is equivalent
              to the scope of data protection in the UK (the UK-GDPR).
            </p>
            <p>
              In relation to the rights and obligations of EU data subjects,
              this Privacy Policy should be interpreted in a way that assures
              maximum compliance with GDPR. Thus, regarding EU data subject, the
              terms of this Privacy Policy are to be understood in accordance
              with the meaning given to them by GDPR.

              personal data, but we also act as a data processor for personal
              data that we process on behalf of our Users.
            </p>
            <p>
              Programiz PRO is the data controller of your personal data

            <h4>Your Rights</h4>
            <p>
              Subject to applicable EU law, you have the following rights in
              relation to your personal data:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Right to be informed: You have the right to concise,
                  transparent, intelligible and easily accessible information
                  regarding the processing of your personal data.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Right of access: If you ask us, we will confirm whether we are
                  processing your personal data and, if so, provide you with a
                  copy of that personal data along with certain other details.
                  If you require additional copies, we may need to charge a
                  reasonable fee.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Right to rectification (updating your information): If your
                  personal data is inaccurate or incomplete, you are entitled to
                  ask that we correct or complete it. If we share your personal
                  data with others, we will tell them about the correction where
                  possible. If you ask us, and where possible and lawful to do
                  so, we will also tell you with whom we shared your personal
                  data so you can contact them directly.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Right to erasure: You may ask us to delete or remove your
                  personal data, such as where our legal basis for the
                  processing is your consent and you withdraw consent. If we
                  share your data with others, we will tell them about the
                  erasure where possible. If you ask us, and where possible and
                  lawful to do so, we will also tell you with whom we shared
                  your personal data with so you can contact them directly. We
                  may continue processing personal data where this is necessary
                  for a legitimate interest in doing so (for example, for
                  compliance with the law), as described in this Privacy Policy.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Right to restrict processing: You may ask us to restrict or
                  ‘block’ the processing of your personal data in certain
                  circumstances, such as where you contest the accuracy of the
                  data or object to us processing it. We will tell you before we
                  lift any restriction on processing. If we share your personal
                  data with others, we will tell them about the restriction
                  where possible. If you ask us, and where possible and lawful
                  to do so, we will also tell you with whom we shared your
                  personal data so you can contact them directly.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Right to data portability: You have the right to obtain your
                  personal data from us that you consented to give us or that
                  was provided to us as necessary in connection with our
                  contract with you. We will give you your personal data in a
                  structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. You may
                  reuse it elsewhere.

                    <li>
                      if we are relying on a legitimate interest to process your
                      personal data — unless we demonstrate compelling
                      legitimate grounds for the processing or
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      if we are processing your personal data for direct

                  Right to withdraw consent: If we rely on your consent to
                  process your personal data, you have the right to withdraw
                  that consent at any time. This will not affect the lawfulness
                  of processing of your data before we received notice that you
                  wished to withdraw your consent.
                </li>

                  local data protection authority. We would, however, appreciate
                  the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the
                  local data protection authority so please contact us in the
                  first instance.
                </li>

              Legal Basis for Processing personal data and Legitimate Interest
            </h4>
            <p>
              Our legal basis for collecting and using the personal data
              described above will depend on the personal data concerned and the
              specific context in which we collect it. If you are an EU
              resident, we will only process your personal data when one (or
              more) of the following requirements is met:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                When we have your consent to do so. If consent is the legal
                basis for the processing of your personal data, you may withdraw
                your consent at any time.
              </li>
              <li>
                When processing is necessary for the performance of the contract
                to which you are a party to (e.g. for providing the services you
                requested).
              </li>
              <li>To comply with our legal obligations.</li>
              <li>
                When it is necessary to protect your vital interests or those of
                other individuals.
              </li>
              <li>
                When processing is necessary for the performance of a task
                carried out in the public interest.
              </li>
              <li>
                When we (or a third party) have a legitimate interest in
                processing your personal data. “Legitimate interests” means our
                interests in conducting our business, managing and delivering
                the best Service to you. This Privacy Policy describes when we
                process your personal data for our legitimate interests, what
                these interests are and your rights. We will not use your
                personal data for activities where the impact on you overrides
                our interests, unless we have your consent or those activities
                are otherwise required or permitted by law.
              </li>
              If we ask you to provide personal data to comply with a legal
              requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this
              clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of
              your personal data is mandatory or not, as well as of the possible
              consequences if you do not provide your personal data.

            <h4>Security and Breach</h4>
            <p>
              Security measures: Appropriate technical and organizational
              measures are implemented to ensure that, by default, the only
              personal data processed are those, which are necessary for each
              specific purpose of processing. This applies to the quantity, the
              extent of the processing, the period of storage and the
              accessibility of the collected personal data. With such measures,
              we try to ensure that personal data are not made accessible to an
              indefinite number of persons without your intervention.
            </p>
            <p>
              In case of a personal data breach: If a personal data breach
              occurs we shall without undue delay, where feasible, not later
              than 72 hours after having become aware of it, notify the
              supervisory authority. This does not apply when the personal data
              breach is unlikely to resolve in risk to your rights and freedoms.
              In case of a risk to your rights and freedoms due to a personal
              data breach, we shall also inform you without undue delay.
            </p>
            <p>
              This does not apply to situations where we have implemented
              appropriate technical and organizational protection measures that
              were applied to the personal data affected by the breach or if our
              subsequent measures ensure that the risk is no longer likely to
              materialize. It also does not apply when it would involve
              disproportionate effort. In the described cases we shall inform
              you through public communication or similar way in an equally
              effective manner.
            </p>
